A proof of concept for Deep Sleep Walk, CountSheep learns to look at an mnist digit and draw the next mnist digit.  Of course, in the process of trying to draw an image from just neural memories, CountSheep distorts its reinterpritation in sometimes chaotic and sometimes meaningful ways.

To begin counting sheep you'll need:

* Python 3
* keras
* matplotlib
* glob
* numpy

Which I recommend you install with pip!

# Controls

* **0-9** reset the initial seed number to be 0 to 9
* **->** Generate the next digit
